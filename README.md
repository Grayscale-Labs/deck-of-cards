# Deck of Cards

## Goal 1
- Implement methods for `Deck` (deck.rb) and `Card` (card.rb)
- Feel free to add or rename methods if you need to

## Goal 2
- Complete *Scenario 1* (`scenario_1.rb`) with your `Deck` class
- Complete *Scenario 2* (`scenario_2.rb`) with your `Deck` class
- Use the `Run` button above to see the output of the scenario
- OR test individual scenarios using the console using the commands below
```
> ruby scenario_1.rb
... the output from scenario 1

> ruby scenario_2.rb
... the output from scenario 2
```

## Bonus
- Implement whatever extra additional methods you think would be interesting. Maybe a `#stack` method to bring all the Aces to the top?
